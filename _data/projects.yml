- project: Driver Safex - Driver Drowsiness Detection System
  duration: Sep, 2022 &mdash; Dec, 2022
  # url: "#"
  description: I designed and developed a machine learning model that was seamlessly integrated into an Android application, incorporating advanced computer vision techniques. The application utilizes Google APIs and computer vision to continuously monitor the driver's eyes in real-time, detecting signs of drowsiness. Through this innovative system, I implemented a proactive alert mechanism that triggers an alarm to immediately alert the driver. Simultaneously, the application shares the driver's location with three designated emergency contacts. This multifaceted approach enhances overall road safety and promotes increased awareness among drivers.
